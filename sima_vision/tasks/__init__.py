"""The task registry, and how a fourth application joins it.

A task is one application: what to do with a frame once the MLA has finished
with it. Everything before that point -- config, assets, the Neat graph, the
pull loop, the sinks -- is shared, so a new one is a single module subclassing
:class:`~sima_vision.tasks.base.Task`, and the subcommand, its flags, its config
sections and its place in ``--help`` all follow from that.

Two ways in:

**In this package.** Write the module and add the class to :data:`BUILTIN`.

**In your own package.** Advertise an entry point, and `pip install` it next to
this one::

    [project.entry-points."sima_vision.tasks"]
    count = "my_package.count:CountTask"

which is enough for ``sima-vision count`` to exist, with the shared flags, the
asset handling and the automatic setup already attached. Nothing is edited here.
A plugin that fails to import is reported and skipped rather than taking the
whole CLI down with it: one broken third-party package must not stop
``sima-vision detect`` from running.
